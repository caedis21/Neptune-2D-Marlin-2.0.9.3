# Neptune-2D-Marlin-2.0.9.3
Configuration for Marlin 2.0.9.3 for Neptune 2D with Marlin Touch/Color UI. Not really familiar with Git yet, so I am not sure how to use forks and merges. Trying to learn, though! Original configurations were acquired from https://github.com/just-trey/Marlin

Changed default colors for aesthetics and visibility.

Currently trying to get LVGL UI to work properly with Marlin 2.0.9.3
